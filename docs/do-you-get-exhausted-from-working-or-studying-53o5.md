# 你会因为工作或学习而筋疲力尽吗？

> 原文：<https://dev.to/robencom/do-you-get-exhausted-from-working-or-studying-53o5>

页（page 的缩写）忍耐一下，我想尝试用一种有趣的方式把我的想法写成代码

```
function Success(you) 
{

    if (you == wanna_be_successful)
    {

        study new things, after work, every day (5 days a week), 
        for at least 1 hour a day,
        to keep you = up-to-date and aware of all the new technologies;       

    }
    else
    {

        you = lag behind your peers and you kinda become value-less 
        in the market;

    }

    return you;

}

function Lately(I, experience)
{

    let I = PHP Developer
    let experience = 5 years
    let me = []

    2 weeks ago, I refreshed my knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript;
    It felt amazing to catch up with the new additions (especially ECMA6);
    me.push('happy');

    I could study all day long;
    I studied every day, even in weekends;
    me.push('consistent'); 

    I thought about it whenever I was hanging out with my family and friends;
    I couldn't wait to go back to study more and more;
    me.push('confident');

    return me;

}

function now(me)
{
    me = [];    

    after those 2 weeks, I couldn't read a single word without feeling
    that my brain is gonna explode;
    me.push('exhausted');

    I moved on to do some working on my own website;
    But I still feel like my brain has shrunk or something;
    I cannot focus;
    me.push('empty');

    My intuition tells me that my brain is tired and needs time to relax;
    My (personal) deadlines make me nervous;
    me.push('nervous');

    return me;

}

function YourThoughts(yourThoughts)
{

    what are your experiences with this;
    Too much working, too much studying;
    Should we rest after too much work/study;
    How long should we rest;

    It's been almost 3 days that I cannot do a significant work,
    but I NEED to work, the "world" cannot wait for me that long;

    return yourThoughts;

}
